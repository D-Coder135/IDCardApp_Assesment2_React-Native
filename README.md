# ProfileCreatorApp(Live Assessment)🧑‍🏫👩‍🏫

## My Goal

The objective of this project was to build a hybrid profile creator application using JavaScript & React-Native within 3 hours of allotted time in a Live Assessment Test. The application navigates through three screens in total. The application also stores the user's details on an online Realtime Database of Google's Firebase. As soon as the user registers with his details, the data gets uploaded to the Realtime Database and on the profile page the data is fetched from the database. The application is compatible on various platforms like Android, iOS, and Web.
